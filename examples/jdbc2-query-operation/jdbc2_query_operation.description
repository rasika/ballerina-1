// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client select query operations
// with the stream return type. Note that the relevant database driver JAR
// should be placed in the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder. However, this sample
// is based on an H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR is included by
// default in the Ballerina distribution. Therefore, it is not required to copy
// the driver JAR for H2 databases.

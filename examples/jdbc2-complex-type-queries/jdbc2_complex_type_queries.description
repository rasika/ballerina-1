// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client with complex data types
// such as arrays, binary, blobs, clob, and date/time fields. Note that the
// relevant database  driver JAR should be placed in the
// `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder. However, this sample is based on an H2
// database and the H2 database driver JAR is included by  default in the
// Ballerina distribution. Therefore, it is not required to copy the driver JAR
// for the H2 database.

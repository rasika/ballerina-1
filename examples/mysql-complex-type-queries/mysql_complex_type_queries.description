// This example demonstrates how to use the MySQL client with complex data types
// such as binary, blobs, and date/time fields. Note that the MySQL database
// driver JAR should be placed in the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` directory. The
// MySQL connector uses some database properties from MySQL version 8.0.x
// onwards. Therefore, it is recommended to use a MySQL driver version greater
// than 8.0.x.

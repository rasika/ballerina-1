// An object is assignable to another object type if they are structurally equivalent. There are rules that need to
// be satisfied for objects to be structurally equivalent. The following are the general equivalency rules
// that are applicable for objects.
//
// Both objects should have the same access modifier (i.e., either both should be public or both should be private).
// If both objects are private, they should be in the same package.
// The right hand side (RHS) object type should at least have all the fields as well as the methods of the left hand side (LHS) type.
// If the objects are public object types, all the fields and methods must be public as well.
// The field types of the RHS object should be assignable to the field types of the LHS object.
// The method signatures of the RHS object type should match the method signatures of the LHS object type.
// The parameters and return types of the RHS object type should also be the same types or subtypes of
// the corresponding parameters and return types of the LHS object type.

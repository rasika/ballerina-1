// This example demonstrates how to initialize the MySQL client with different
// initialization options. Note that, the MySQL database driver JAR should be
// placed in the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` directory. The MySQL connector uses
// database properties from MySQL version 8.0.x onwards. Therefore, it is
// recommended to use a MySQL driver version greater than 8.0.x

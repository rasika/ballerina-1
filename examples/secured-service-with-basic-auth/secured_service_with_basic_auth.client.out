# Since the resource configuration has overridden the required scopes to denote
# that `scope2` is required to invoke `sayHello` resource, the invocation will
# fail during authorization.
$ curl -k -u alice:password1 https://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
Authorization failure

# Since `bob` has `scope2`, the invocation will succeed.
$ curl -k -u bob:password2 https://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
Hello, World!!!

// A Task scheduler can be used to create timers to trigger periodically. A
// service can be attached to the task Scheduler object using the `attach()`
// function and the Listener can be started using the `start()` function.
// The service that is being attached must contain the `onTrigger()` resource function.
// Additionally, a user can pass a set of `any` values to the resource using
// the `attach()` function, which then can be used inside the `onTrigger()`
// function. The Listener can be stopped by calling the `stop()` function.

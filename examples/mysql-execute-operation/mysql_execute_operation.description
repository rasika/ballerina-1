// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client with the DDL and  DML
// operations. Note that the MySQL database driver JAR should be placed in
// the`BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` directory. The MySQL connector uses database
// properties from MySQL version 8.0.x onwards. Therefore, it is
// recommended to use a MySQL driver version greater than 8.0.x.

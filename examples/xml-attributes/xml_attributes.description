// XML elements may have any number of attributes and any number
// of namespace declarations that apply for that element. 
// In Ballerina, both of these types are treated the same. 
// XML attribute access in Ballerina is lax-typed similar
// to `json`, we can use field access expression (`.`) and
// optional field access expressions (``?.`) to access the
// attribute of an XML value.

// A `query expression` is a list comprehension, which can be used with a value that is iterable with any error type.
// It consists of four kinds of clauses: `from`, `let`, `where`, and `select`.
// The first clause must be a `from` clause and the last clause must be a `select`.
// The result of the query expression is a list.
// This is a preview feature.
